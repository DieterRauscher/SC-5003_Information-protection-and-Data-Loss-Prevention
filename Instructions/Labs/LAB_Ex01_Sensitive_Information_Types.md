# Lab 1 - Exercise 3 - Manage Sensitive Information Types

Contoso Ltd. previously had issues with employees accidentally sending out personal information from customers when working on support tickets in the ticketing solution. To educate users in the future, a custom sensitive information type is required to identify employee IDs in emails and documents, which consist of three uppercase characters and six numbers. To lower the false positive rate, the keywords "Employee" and "IDs" will be used. In this task you will create a new custom sensitive information type, a database for EDM-based classification and a keyword dictionary. 

## Task 1 – Create custom sensitive information types

In this exercise, you will use the Security & Compliance Center PowerShell module to create a new custom sensitive information type that recognizes the pattern of employee IDs near the keywords "Employee" and "ID".

1. You should still be logged into Client 1 VM (LON-CL1) as the **lon-cl1\admin** account.

1. In **Microsoft Edge**, navigate to **https://compliance.microsoft.com** and log into the Microsoft Purview portal as JoniS@WWLxZZZZZZ.onmicrosoft.com (where ZZZZZZ is your unique tenant ID provided by your lab hosting provider). Joni's password should be provided by your lab hosting provider.

1. Expand **Data classification** from the left pane and select **Classifiers**

1. If a **What is data classification?** message is displayed, select **Close**.

1. Select **Sensitive info types** from the top pane.  

   >**Hint:** If **Sensitive info types** doesn't appear in the Purview portal, then it's possible Joni's permissions update to Compliance Admin in the earlier lab has not updated in your browser.  You may have to sign-out and sign-in as JoniS.

1. On the **Sensitive info types** tab select **+ Create sensitive info type** to open the wizard for a new sensitive information type.

1. On the **Name your sensitive info type** page, enter the following information:

    - **Name**: Contoso Employee IDs
    - **Description**: Pattern for Contoso employee IDs.

1. Select **Next**.

1. On the **Define patterns for this sensitive info type** page, select **+ Create pattern**.

1. In the right-side **New pattern** pane, select **+ Add primary element** and select **Regular expression**.

1. In the new right-side pane **Add a regular expression**, enter the following:

    - **ID**: Contoso IDs
    - **Regular expression**: ```[A-Z]{3}[0-9]{6}```
    - *String match*

1. Select **Done**.

1. In the **New pattern** flyout page, below **Supporting elements**, select **+ Add supporting elements or group of elements** drop-down menu and select **Keyword list**.

1. In the new right-side pane **Add a keyword list**, enter the following:

    - **ID**: Employee ID keywords
    - **Case insensitive**:
        - *Employee*
        - *ID*
    - Select the radio button for *Word match* under the **Case Sensitive** field

1. Select **Done**.

1. In the New pattern windows decrease the **Character proximity** value to *100* characters.

1. Select the **Create** button.

1. Back on the **Define patterns for this sensitive info type** page select **Next**.

1. On the **Choose the recommended confidence level to show in compliance policies** page use the default value and select **Next**.

1. On the **Review settings and finish** page review the settings and select **Create**. When successfully created select **Done**.

1. Leave the browser window open.

You have successfully created a new sensitive information type to identify employee IDs in the pattern of three uppercase characters, six numbers, and the keywords 'Employee' or 'IDs' within a range of 100 characters.

## Task 2 – Create EDM-based classification information type

As an extra search pattern, you will create an Exact Data Match (EDM) based classification with a database schema of employee data. The database source file will be formatted with the following data fields of employees: Name, Birthdate, StreetAddress, and EmployeeID.

1. You should still be logged into Client 1 VM (LON-CL1) as the **lon-cl1\admin** account, and you should be logged into Microsoft 365 as **Joni Sherman**.
